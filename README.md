# Control an LED using Arduino Cloud  
### Using Arduino Cloud and NodeMCU-ESP8266 to control an LED over the cloud.  

***Overview :***  
The main goal of the project is to control an LED over the cloud, just by flicking a switch on your phone/laptop from anywhere in the world, provided you have internet connection. This basic project helps you understand how the NodeMCU and Arduino Cloud integrates with each other.  

***Required Components :***
- NodeMCU-ESP8266 Development Board
- Resistor - 1k Ohm
- LED - any colour  
<br/>

***Software Requirements :***
- Arduino Cloud account
- Arduino IDE
<br/>

***Connections :***

***Versions :***  
- `v1.0.0` - First prototype of the project, designed by [Bharadwaj Routhu](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-R)  
<br/>

***Motivation Behind the Project :***  
I learnt the basics of Cloud Computing, and wanted to explore the applications of it in IoT. But Arduino Uno is not suitable for this as it can't connect to internet. The next low-cost alternative I found out was NodeMCU with ESP8266 WiFi chip. This simple project was done by me as the first step in exploring the world of WiFi enabled chips and IoT cloud. Hope you like my project and if you do, please star the project and consider following me.
